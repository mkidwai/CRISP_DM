## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I have used the data from Stack Overflow 2020 developer survey to answer the below questions:

1. What are the top languages used by the surveyed people along with the desired to be learned next year?
2. Looking at the data for languages used and desired, is it different between developers by profession and others?
3. How job seeking is compared across different segmentation?
4. Aside from compnensation, benefits and location, what factors are important when looking for a job?
